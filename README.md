# MakeMkvActivator
Script to scrape the current MakeMkv beta key and install it

## Purpose
MakeMkvActivator is a simple python 3 script that scrapes the MakeMkv forum page and retrieves the current beta activation key. If the installed key is not the same as the current key, the current key will be installed.

Currently Windows and MacOS are supported. 

This is my first script using Python, so if you find any bugs or have any suggestions on what can be done to make this code better/more efficent please feel free to reach out.

If you enjoy the MakeMkv software, consider purchasing a license to support the developer for future/continued development.

## Requirements
Python 3 and BeautifulSoup

1. First install Python 3 and make sure installation path is added to your PATH variable
2. run the following command using cmd (windows) or terminal (mac):
pip3 install beautifulsoup4
